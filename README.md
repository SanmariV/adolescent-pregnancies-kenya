Adolescent Pregnancies in Kenya, 2016 - 2020
================

## Introduction

The impact of Covid-19 on women and girls has been greatly felt over the
past 100 days of COVID 19 in Kenya. With effects such as loss of
livelihood leading to economic challenges, in accessibility to health
service for pre and post-natal care. This also includes exposure to
domestic violence due to the measures put in place to curb the spread of
the CoronaVirus.

Among these impacts is the unprecedented impact on children attending
school. New reports show a steep rise in the number of young girls aged
10-19 presenting with pregnancy. In 2020 thereâ€™s a noted spike in the
numbers reported between March to May compared to the reports of the
same time period in 2019. These changes could be attributed to the
closure of schools due to COVID-19 among other factors the work of Women
in GIS Kenya (WiGISKe) will highlight this via data science.

This repository is my attempt to visualize the data supplied by Women in
GIS Kenya (WiGISKe) and the DHIS2. The dashboard of the data
visualization can be found
